Hi, I’m Gailyn.

I’m building a portfolio focused on AI-powered creative systems using Azure cloud foundations.

Current focus areas:

Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)

AI workloads and responsible AI

Generative AI for creative content

Cloud-based deployment of AI projects

This repository will document projects, experiments, and architecture diagrams as I grow.
